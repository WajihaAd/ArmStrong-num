# Armstrong Numbers Program

This Python program determines whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.

## Introduction

An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number, plenary number, or pluperfect number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `armstrong_numbers.py` file directly.

2. Run the program using Python:

    ```
    python armstrong_numbers.py
    ```

3. Enter a number when prompted.

4. The program will then check if the entered number is an Armstrong number or not and display the result.

## Example

Suppose you enter the number `153`. Here's how the output will look:

```
Enter a number: 153
The number is an Armstrong number
```
